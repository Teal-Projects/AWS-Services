h1. Description 

Amazon Macie automatically and continuously discovers sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, that an enterprise stores in AWS, and then uses natural language processing to classify that data and assign it a business value. This provides an administrator with more visibility into storage locations for sensitive data, its importance to the business and how users interact with it. This also helps an organization maintain compliance, and eliminates the need for an IT team to manually classify data and permissions to it.
