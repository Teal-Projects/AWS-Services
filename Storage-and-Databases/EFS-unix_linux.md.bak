h1. Description 


Amazon Elastic File System is a file storage service for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Amazon EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

* Is designed for active file system workloads and you pay only for the amount of file system storage you use per month.

h5. EFS Bursting Throughput (Default)
* Is cost-optimized for files accessed less frequently. Data stored on the Infrequent Access storage class costs less than Standard and you will pay a fee each time you read from or write to a file.

h5. EFS Provisioned Throughput
* Like the default Bursting Throughput mode, the Provisioned Throughput mode also includes 50 KB/s per GB (or 1 MB/s per 20 GB) of throughput in the price of EFS Standard storage. You are billed only for the throughput provisioned above what you are provided based on data you have stored.
